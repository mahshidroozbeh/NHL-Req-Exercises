# **Debugging Challenges in Computational Tasks**

Welcome to this repository, which documents a series of debugging challenges encountered within the realm of computational programming. These challenges span from straightforward data type discrepancies to intricate bugs found within widely-used tutorials online.

## **Overview of Challenges**

### **Challenge 1: Fruit Identifier via ID**

- **Objective**: Implement a function to map a numerical ID to a corresponding fruit name within an unordered collection.
- **Encountered Issues**:
    1. **Direct Indexing Failure**: The unordered nature of Python sets leads to unpredictable outcomes when attempting direct indexing.
    2. **Resolution Approach**: Conversion of the set to a list facilitates reliable direct indexing.

### **Challenge 2: Coordinate Swapping in Arrays**

- **Objective**: Develop a function capable of interchanging the x and y coordinates within an array representing bounding box parameters.
- **Encountered Issues**:
    1. **Incorrect Swapping Logic**: Initial attempts at swapping led to incorrect assignments, distorting the intended outcome.
    2. **Resolution Approach**: Properly manage the swapping logic to ensure accurate assignment and preserve the intended coordinate structure.

### **Challenge 3: Precision-Recall Curve Visualization**

- **Objective**: Visualize a precision-recall curve using dataset values stored in a CSV file.
- **Encountered Issues**:
    1. **Visualization Discrepancies**: Initial plots did not correctly reflect the dataset due to improper handling of data types and axis assignments.
    2. **Resolution Approach**: Parse data as floats and accurately assign data to the correct axes for faithful representation.

### **Challenge 4: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Optimization**

- **Objective**: Optimize a GAN for generating images that closely mimic handwritten digits, discerning between authentic and generated images.
- **Encountered Issues**:
    1. **Batch Size Mismatch Error**: Adjusting the batch size led to tensor dimension mismatches, highlighting a structural bug.
    2. **Cosmetic Visualization Issue**: Identified a need for improvement in the update and visualization logic for generated images.
    3. **Resolution Approach**: Implement dynamic tensor sizing and refine visualization strategies for enhanced clarity.

## **Goals and Learning Outcomes**

The primary aim of these debugging exercises was to sharpen problem-solving skills within scientific and computational programming contexts. Through meticulous analysis and resolution of these varied challenges, profound insights into routine programming pitfalls and their solutions were unearthed.
